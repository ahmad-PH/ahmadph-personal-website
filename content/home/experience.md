  - Owned migration of Sponsored Product APIs from Ruby to a Go microservice and the team's Active Record dependencies to an in-house Go query builder, using shadow testing and launching with zero incidents, unblocking infrastructure switchover.
  - Built an Agentic AI Slack bot for on-call incident triage using ADK, with RAG to search over the codebase context, and an MCP server for the company's feature variants service, to improve incident response time and developer productivity.
  - Investigated and resolved a major revenue-impacting issue in data pipelines, in a cross-team collaboration, through extensive SQL analysis in Snowflake and visualizations in Mode dashboards, with comprehensive data-health checks to prevent regressions.
  - Launched specialized promotional campaigns tailored to a specific partner's needs with custom backend logic, collaborating across Sales, Product, and Data Science, resulting in the partner doubling their ads and promotions budget investment with Instacart.

  I developed a Telegram bot, which would provide another way for customers to access the company's services in addition to its Android & ios applications. People would have access to all of the essential functionality of the Android & ios applications, but it would have the advantage of no installation requirement, platform independence, and ease of use for customers with less technical understanding. This internship taught me a great deal about web development, especially back-end web development, Node.js, and MongoDB.
