I am a Software Engineer based in Toronto with a Master’s in applied computing from the University of Toronto and a rich blend of experience in full-stack web development and machine learning gathered through my various previous roles. These include working at a software startup, machine learning research labs in both academia and industry, and my current role at a growing software company. I love writing software that makes people’s lives easier and more productive, so I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to innovate and improve processes. When I’m not writing code for work, I’m either working on my side projects, reading, or grinding my MMR in my favourite video games! Feel free to reach out if you have an idea for a project you think I’d be interested in!

<!-- 
I am an MScAC (MSc in Applied Computing) student at the University of Toronto, in the computer science concentration. I am currently working on a natural language processing project as a machine learning intern at the [Samsung AI Centre - Toronto (SAIC)](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) under the supervision of [Dr. Fazly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afsaneh-fazly-98538b4/?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Dr. Rudzicz](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/). I chose the MScAC program because I love working on practical, real-world problems in which I can see the effect of my work more directly, and the applied research internship component of this program was a great fit for me. -->
