  I developed a Telegram bot, which would provide another way for customers to access the company's services in addition to its Android & ios applications. People would have access to all of the essential functionality of the Android & ios applications, but it would have the advantage of no installation requirement, platform independence, and ease of use for customers with less technical understanding. This internship taught me a great deal about web development, especially back-end web development, Node.js, and MongoDB.
