I am an MScAC student at the University of Toronto, in the computer science concentration. I am currently working on a natural language processing project as a machine learning intern at the [Samsung AI Centre - Toronto (SAIC)](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) under the supervision of [Dr. Fazly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afsaneh-fazly-98538b4/?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Dr. Rudzicz](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/) as my industry and academic supervisors, respectively. I chose the MScAC program because I love working on practical, real-world problems in which I can see the effect of my work more directly, and the applied research internship component of this program was a great fit for me.
