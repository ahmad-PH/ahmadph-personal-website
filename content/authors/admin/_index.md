I am a fresh graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) with a GPA of 3.97 (19.41/20). Through my years as an undergraduate, I have become quite interested in artificial intelligence, and that's why I have spent the last few years trying to gain as much experience in the field as possible. This started with attending two summer schools on deep learning in the summers of 2017 and 2018, continued with auditing Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization on Coursera, was followed by a machine learning internship at [Sensifai](https://sensifai.com/) in the following year, and finally led me to choose a topic related to adversarial examples as the subject for my bachelor's project in the final semester. Currently, I am a research assistant at the Data Analytics Lab at the University of Tehran, working on the application of deep learning on a combinatorial optimization problem on graphs.

Besides artificial intelligence, I also love developing software and in addition to the coursework at university, I practice it via internships and small projects whenever I find the time to. In my free time, I like playing video games, playing chess, reading epic fantasies, and occasionally reading about psychology and philosophy.
